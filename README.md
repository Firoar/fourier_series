# 🎨 Fourier Series Drawing Machine

## 📌 Overview

This project uses **Fourier Series** and **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to recreate drawings using rotating circles (epicycles).
An input path is converted into a sequence of points, transformed into Fourier coefficients, and animated to show how multiple rotating vectors combine to trace the original image.
